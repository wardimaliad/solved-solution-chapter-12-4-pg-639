Design, implement, and test a class that represents an amount of time in minutes and seconds. The class should provide a constructor that sets the time to a specified number of minutes and seconds. The default constructor should create an object for a time of zero minutes and zero seconds. The class should provide observers that return the minutes and the seconds separately, and an observer that returns the total time in seconds. Boolean comparison observers should be provided that test wheter two times are equal, one time is greater, or one time is less than the other. A function should be provided that adds one time to another, and another function that subtracts one time from another. The class should not allow negative times (subtraction of more time than is currently stored should result in a time of 0:00). This class should be immutable.
